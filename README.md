International slugs
==================

**Warning: Please give all your contenttypes a defined slug when using this
extension since it can otherwise mess with bolts DB table naming**

This extension allows you to define custom rules for the slugs that are
generated by bolt. For example you can allow uppercase and special characters.

For configuration help see the included config file.
